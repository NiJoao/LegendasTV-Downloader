LegendasTV-Downloader
=====================

Works great for TV-Shows, but gets unsynced subtitles for some movies, depending on naming schemes on both the file and legendas.tv website.

------

1. Install python (v2.7 recommended) and the modules: BeautifulSoup4, rarfile

2. Open the file 'ltv-downloader.py' with any text editor

3. Edit the first configuration lines with your username and password for legendas.tv website

4. Drag-and-Drop videos or folders on 'ltv-downloader.py'

5. Enjoy!
