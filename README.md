LegendasTV-Downloader
=====================

Single-file script that scans a folder for videos and download subtitles for all of them from legendas.tv

Works great for TV-Shows, but gets unsynced subtitles for some movies, depending on naming schemes on both video-file and legendas.tv website.

HoTo:

1. Open the file 'ltv-downloader.py'

2. Edit the first configuration lines with you username and password for legendas.tv website

3. Install python (v2.7 recommended) and the modules: BeautifulSoup4, rarfile

4. Drag-and-Drop videos or folders on 'ltv-downloader.py'

5. Enjoy!
